<h1>MYSELF</h1>
<p>I am Satya Prakash Dash.I am from Odisha ,India. I  want to be a Web Developer.
 I want to be rich.I love a lot of things like Video games , Traking ,Gardening etc.
</p>


<p>I am totally into Bikes and Cars.I just love long rides.
  I have a very long Wishlist to buy but most of all I wanted a MAC first.Now I have got one and I 
  am learning a course on Web development from Udemy.It was suggested by a very good friend of mine and he is the person I admire.
  He is totally a way ahead of me but I want to catch up to him and see myself in a equal position with him.That said I am actually 
  aiming to earn a decent  amount of money to fulfil all my wishes.I just don’t want to bother my father to buy me those.
  I want to make him proud of me.
</p>

 
<p>Basically I am complete loser in my part of life.I messed up many big things and now I’m totally screwed .
  I like kind of cheated on my girlfriend but she was good enough to give me a second chance.for whom I cheated her cheated on me n I 
  got my all respect n all trust from her on the earth.The big part is I am with her still n she  is standing beside me with all her pain 
  hiding within her.I am really blessed to have her and I deeply thank god for sending her to my life.
</p>

<p>And about my parents , they are the best and so supportive with every field.
  I just love them and they are so cool also that when I said about my relation ship 
  they instantly agreed and supported me to overcome with all my bullshit.
